Rules:
There are no red face-cards, red Aces, and Jokers from a standard deck. Start with 20 HP.
Four cards will be draw and you can either run which will draw four more cards or pick three of them in any order. You cannot run twice in a row.
Diamonds (Weapons): Equip to boost your attacks (replacing your old weapon).
Hearts (Potions): Heal up to your 20 HP maximum (one per turn).
Clubs & Spades (Monsters): Fight either bare-handed or with your weapon—damage to you equals monster’s value minus your weapon’s value (or full value if unarmed).
The game ends when your HP hits zero (your score is the negative sum of all remaining monsters) or you clear the deck (your score is your remaining HP).
